## this is the production environment
## there are different environments while building services like development, testing, production etc
## each of these have different configurations, routes, resources etc and need to be handled differently
## this is the production config, separate from the regular, development one

                - StripPrefix=1 # removal of a specified prefix from the incoming request path before forwarding the request to the downstream service. #E.g.: Client sends a request to http://localhost:4004/api/v2/patients/all. Assuming strip-prefix = 2, backend service will receive request as http://localost:4000/patients/all, as characters until 2 backslashes are removed, so /api/v2 is removed
