# üè• Patient Management System

A scalable and modular **Patient Management System** built with a microservice architecture for handling healthcare workflows. Designed for flexibility, high availability, and performance, the system leverages modern cloud-native technologies and communication patterns to streamline patient data management, authentication, and inter-service coordination.

---

## üöÄ Features

* **Microservices Architecture**
  Decoupled services handling core functions like patient records, authentication, appointments, and notifications.

* **Database**
  PostgreSQL used as the primary relational database for structured and transactional data storage.

* **Cloud Deployment**
  Deployed on **AWS** using **Docker** and **Kubernetes**, enabling scalable container orchestration.

* **Inter-Service Communication**

  * **HTTP** for standard RESTful interactions
  * **gRPC** for high-performance, low-latency communication between microservices

* **Asynchronous Messaging**
  Integrated with **Apache Kafka** to manage event-driven communication and decoupled data flow.

* **Local Development Support**
  Used **LocalStack** to simulate AWS services locally for efficient development and testing.

* **Infrastructure as Code**
  Configured infrastructure components using **AWS CloudFormation** for reproducible deployments.

* **AWS Services**

  * Configured **ECS clusters**, **API Gateway**, and **Application Load Balancers (ALB)**
  * Implemented secure and scalable services for authentication and access control

* **API Documentation**
  Generated using **OpenAPI Specification** for standardized and interactive API verification.

* **Testing**
  Performed thorough **unit** and **integration testing** across all services to ensure reliability.
